# Word2Vec-Playground
Having some fun learning about Word2Vec and the papers surrounding it for my research project.

## How do I use this wonderful mess?
**Note:** _I use Anaconda though any distribution of Python 3 provided that Gensim (Tested on 3.4.0) is available, it's compatible._

To launch:
`python the_playground.py`

It searches for data in the data directory. It accepts GZipped text files as a corpus.

In the future it is planned to save the trained output to save time, there is likely already a function for this. This is just a basic demo in its current state.
